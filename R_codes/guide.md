This folder can be used to replicate the results for the _Voice, Arrhythmia and Parkinson_ datasets in the [**UCI ML Repository**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php). The datasets went trough some prepocessing in order to guarantee good sampling for _Stan_. The already preprocessed datasets can be found in the Folder [Data](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Mixture_IS-A64E/Data/). 

To replicate the results one just have to run the code [Lppd.R](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Mixture_IS-A64E/R_codes/Logistic_Model_R/Lppd.R), selecting the desidered dataset from the available ones at the top of the code.
